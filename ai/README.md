# AI-assisted development guidelines

This repository contains comprehensive guidelines for using AI-based tools effectively to improve developer productivity and enable product managers to create reusable prototype code.

## Purpose

These guidelines aim to:

1. Help developers leverage AI capabilities to write production-grade code
2. Enable product managers to create functional prototypes that developers can reuse
3. Establish best practices for collaboration between PMs and developers using Cursor
4. Reduce the learning curve for teams adopting AI-assisted development
