## Code Review Pyramid

Our code review process follows a structured pyramid approach, focusing on different aspects of code quality:

1. **Code Style & Formatting** (Base Level)
   - Consistent indentation and spacing
   - Naming conventions
   - Line length limits
   - Import/export organization
   - Automated using tools like Prettier and ESLint

2. **Tests & Coverage**
   - Test coverage requirements (80%+)
   - Unit and integration tests
   - Edge case testing
   - Performance tests for critical paths

3. **Documentation & Comments**
   - README completeness
   - API documentation
   - Inline comments for complex logic
   - Architecture decision records (ADRs)

4. **Implementation Logic**
   - Business logic correctness
   - Algorithm efficiency
   - Error handling
   - Security considerations
   - Performance optimization

5. **Architecture & Design** (Top Level)
   - Design pattern appropriateness
   - SOLID principles
   - Scalability considerations
   - System integration approach

## Coding Standards

### General Principles
- Write clean, maintainable, and self-documenting code
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Comment complex logic, but prefer self-documenting code

### Language-Specific Guidelines
- JavaScript/TypeScript: Follow ESLint rules and TypeScript best practices
- Python: Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Java: Follow Google Java Style Guide
- SQL: Use consistent formatting and naming conventions

### Security Best Practices
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure authentication and authorization
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Regular security audits and dependency updates

## Design & Documentation

### Architecture Documentation
- System design documents
- API specifications (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Database schema documentation
- Infrastructure diagrams

### Code Documentation
- README files for each project
- JSDoc/TypeDoc for API documentation
- Inline comments for complex logic
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### Design Patterns
- Use appropriate design patterns
- Document pattern usage and rationale
- Consider maintainability and scalability
- Follow SOLID principles

## Testing & Test Automation

### Testing Levels
1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test individual components
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Aim for high coverage

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test component interactions
   - Use test databases
   - Mock external services

3. **End-to-End Tests**
   - Test complete user flows
   - Use realistic test data
   - Automate critical paths

### Test Automation
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Automated test runs
- Performance testing
- Security scanning

## Deployment

### Deployment Process
- Use infrastructure as code
- Implement blue-green deployments
- Follow semantic versioning
- Maintain deployment documentation

### Environment Management
- Development
- Staging
- Production
- Feature environments

### Monitoring & Logging
- Application metrics
- Error tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Security monitoring

## AI & Data

### AI Development Guidelines
- Model versioning
- Data preprocessing standards
- Model evaluation metrics
- Ethical considerations

### Data Management
- Data quality standards
- Data privacy compliance
- Data pipeline documentation
- Data versioning

### Machine Learning Operations
- Model deployment
- Model monitoring
- A/B testing
- Model retraining
